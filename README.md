âœ¨ Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ âœ¨
I am Brian AÃ±ano, an undergraduate BS Meteorology student at Visayas State University (VSU).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final course project in CSci135 (Computer Applications in Meteorology). For that project, I intend to use Python programming to determine and visualize the evironmental steering of a tropical cyclone of my choice, using any form of meteorological gridded dataset (e.g. GFS Analysis, ERA5 Reanalysis). ðŸŒ€
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in Python.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to use Python in implementing vortex detection and removal from a given wind velocity field extracted from a gridded dataset (including how to interpolate the wind velocity field once the vortex is removed).
