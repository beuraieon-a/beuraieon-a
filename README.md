âœ¨ Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ âœ¨

I am Brian AÃ±ano, an undergraduate BS Meteorology student at Visayas State University (VSU).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in Python and its usage in the field of meteorology.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to use Python in implementing vortex detection and removal from a given wind velocity field extracted from a gridded meteorological dataset (including how to interpolate the wind velocity field once the vortex is removed). ðŸŒ€

- âš¡ Fun fact: My hometown is Guiuan in the province of Eastern Samar. Guiuan is the town where Super Typhoon Haiyan made its first landfall back in November 2013, and I was one of the survivors of the monster storm. ðŸŒ€
