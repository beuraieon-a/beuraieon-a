### Hi there 👋

<!--
**beuraieon-a/beuraieon-a** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello, world! I am Brian Añano, an undergraduate BS Meteorology student at Visayas State University (VSU).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final course project in CSci135 (Computer Applications in Meteorology). For that project, I intend to use Python programming to determine and visualize the evironmental steering of a tropical cyclone of my choice, using any form of meteorological gridded dataset (e.g. GFS Analysis, ERA5 Reanalysis). 🌀
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Python.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to use Python in implementing vortex detection and removal from a given wind velocity field extracted from a gridded dataset (including how to interpolate the wind velocity field once the vortex is removed).

- ⚡ Fun fact: My hometown is Guiuan in the province of Eastern Samar. Guiuan is the town where Super Typhoon Haiyan made its first landfall back in November 2013, and I was one of the survivors of the monster storm. 🌀
